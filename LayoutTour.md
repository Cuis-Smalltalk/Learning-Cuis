Exploring morph layouts in Cuis
===============================

This file is about how graphic entities, Morphs, may change as they are resized.

A Morph which contains other Morphs may be resized and wish to maintain positional relationships between the contained Morphs.

We call this maintaining the submorph "layout".  We want to lay out each morph in a way that they are well related. 

Cuis has LayoutMorphs which do this for their submorphs.

Let's see how.

### Getting the layout edit panels

First we will load two tools to help us see how LayoutMorphs and LayoutSpecs are used and what they do.

Cuis remains small and comprehensible in part because we have Features which can be loaded as needed.  Each Feature is in a text package which notes its requirements.  To get the tools I want I open a Cuis image, Control-click to get the World Menu, Open a Workspace, and 

````Smalltalk
  Feature require: #'Morphic-Misc1'.
````

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-001.png)

Of course, this won't work very well unless you actually have the packaged code for this Feature.

What I do is maintain a Cuis directory where I clone git repositories for all Cuis-Smalltalk-* features.

In Linux, I open a command line window.

-  cd ~/Cuis
-  git clone https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Morphic
-  cd Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev 
-   "open a cuis image"

OK. I am running a Cuis image with a Workspace and have required Feature #'Morphic-Misc1".

Let's create a LayoutMorph to see what it does.

````Smalltalk
	myLayout := LayoutMorph newRow.
````

Note how the "syntax hilighting" in Cuis helps.  Class names are bold+black, message names are blue, symbols (#) are bold+blue.  "myLayout" is initially undefined (unrecognized) and shows up in red. This is temporary. 

I select the new text and type Cmd-d (DoIt) and see ... not much has changed, except "myLayout" is now blue.

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-002.png)

Ah!  Let me open it in the current Cuis World.  The Cuis backdrop is a PasteUpMorph which we call the World.

````Smalltalk
myLayout morphExtent: 400@300; color: Color skyBlue; openInWorld.
````

I took a shortcut here.  I sent three messages on one line.  The ';' (semicolon) character introduces a "cascade".  What a cascade does is to send messages to the original recever object.

So the above is the same as typing:

````Smalltalk
  myLayout morphExtent: 400@300. 
  myLayout color: Color skyBlue.
  myLayout openInWorld.
````

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-003.png)

### Add submorphs

Well, a skyBlue rectangle is not much to work with.  Let's add a few submorphs -- morphs which are contained in the skyBlue LayoutMorph.

````Smalltalk
myLayout addMorph: (RectangleLikeMorph new :: color: Color blue; yourself).
````

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-004.png)

This introduces a different shortcut: "::".  The double-colon acts like ";" except that it uses the result of the previous message send as the target of the new message send. This shortcut is called a "chain".

If we had typed

````Smalltalk
  RectangleLikeMorph new ; color: Color blue;
````

the #color: message would have been sent to the RectangleLikeMorph class, the target of the original message.

````Smalltalk
  RectangleLikeMorph new :: color: Color blue
````

on the other hand sends #color: to the result of (RectangleLikeMorph new), which is a new instance of a RectangleLikeMorph.
  Using a cascade with #yourself allows us to get the target receiver, the RectangleLikeMorph, which is then the argument to #addMorph: message sent to our LayoutMorph.

Whew!  OK.  No more shortcuts.  But these two shortcuts, cascade and chain, are very useful.

Back to layouts.

Let's add a simple EllipseMorph instance

````Smalltalk
  myLayout addMorph: EllipseMorph new.
````

Add a default ImageMorph, a cute little Cuis!

````Smalltalk
  myLayout addMorph: ImageMorph new.
````

Your Cuis World should look something like this.

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-005.png)

We have a blue rectangle, a yellow ellipse, and a cuis image in a row.

### LayoutMorph intro

Command-click (Windows button3) on the larger, skyBlue rectangle to get its "construction halo". 

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-006.png)

Click on the blue circle at top left to get a "context menu" for the LayoutMorph.

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-007.png)

Select 'edit me (a LayoutMorph)'

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-008.png)

Let's move the LayoutEditor a bit to the right to see what is going on.  Also, click on the "push pin" in the label area at the end of the name of the Morph whose Layout we are editing.

If you don't click on the push-pin to keep the edit panel around, it will disappear when you click on either the Update or Cancel buttons.

This is great for "one shot" changes, but we will be trying a number of things and getting a new edit panel each time would be tiring.

In the Padding area of the layout edit panel, click on the Center circle.  This is a "radio button" selection.  Only one of the circles can be selected at any one time -- just like pushing the station select button on an old time radio.

Ok.  Now click the Update button below.

Congratulations!  You have just centered the submorphs in the layout row!

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-009.png)

Let's change the LayoutMorph to be a column instead of a row.  Select Direction Column and click Update.

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-010.png)

How about Padding Top and Update.

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-011.png)

Padding Botton and Update.

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-012.png)

If you click on the box to the right of the X or Y, you can backspace (erase) the value and type a new one.  Put '10' in each box and press the enter key.

The press Update.

You should now have a 10 pixel space between the submorphs.

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-013.png)

### LayoutSpec intro

So LayoutMorphs can layout submorphs in a row or a column, position submorphs along the line of the row or column, and set spacing between the Morphs.

What else can we do with layouts?

It turns out that each submorph can tell its containing LayoutMorph how it wants to be sized and placed within its layout.

Command-click (Windows shift-button3) on the yellow ellipse to get its halo, select the blue circle for its context menu, and select 'edit my layoutspec'.

Note that the original command-click halos the outer Morph.  Each additional click halos the next innermost Morph.  The Morph name is in a label at the bottom of the halo.

Move the LayoutSpec edit panel to one side and click on its push-pin.

You should have a World which looks something like the following

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-014.png)

In the Padding section of the EllipseMorph's layout edit panel, click on 'Left/Top' and click on the Update button.

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-015.png)

Aha!  The LayoutMorph places its submorphs in a Column along the center line, but a submorph can specify where it wants to be placed along the cross axis.

By the way, we are starting to get a number of edit panels up.  It can get confusing to remember the funny instance names for the morphs we are applying edit changes to.  If you click on the 'Show Halo' button, or if you click on the 'gear' icon on the title bar, the construction halo for the Morph being edited will appear. 

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-016.png)

So it is always easy to find out who is being edited.

OK.  Let's change the column back into a row.  Click on Row radio button in the layout edit panel and Update to see the other orientation. What do you think will happen?

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-017.png)

You guessed it. The ellipse is now on the top of the row instead of the left of the column.

What else can we do with LayoutSpecs?

Let's set the Width to a Fixed 80 pixels and the Height to 40% of the container, with a 10 pixel minimum and Update.

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-018.png)

So when you resize the layout, the Ellipse keeps the same width, but its height is maintained at approxumately 40% of the LayoutMorph.

Command click on the blue rectangle, select 'edit my layoutspec' from its context menu, move the layoutspec edit panel aside and click on its push-pin.

Now set its Height to Proportional 50% with a minimum of 30 pixels and click Update.  Perhaps a Proportional Width of
80% and min 30 pixels.

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-019.png)

Go ahead and resize the skyBlue LayoutMorph to see how things are kept in place.

If you 'show halo' from the layout edit panel or command-click on the skyBlue rectangle, you can drag the yellow circle on the lower right corner of the LayoutMorph to change its size dynamically.

![Cuis Window](LayoutTour/Cuis-020.png)

By now I expect that you know what the buttons do and can play all day with layouts.

You can use the layout and layoutSpec edit panels to test how you want your Morphs to resize within their containers.

LayoutMorphs can be nested and given their own LayoutSpecs.


In Part 2 on Layouts, we will look at the code for setting up layouts and exploring them.
